# BSN Introduction

##  **What is the BSN:** <a id="what-is-the-bsn"></a>

The Blockchain-based Service Network is a cross-cloud, cross portal and cross framework global public infrastructure network used to deploy and operate all types of blockchain distributed applications \(DApps\).

## **Aims of the BSN:** <a id="aims-of-the-bsn"></a>

The aim of the BSN is to connect together all public and private chains into a global internet of blockchains.

## **How April fits in with BSN:** <a id="how-april-fits-in-with-bsn"></a>

We currently see no via competitor to BSN in this new global blockchain infrastructure network space save Amazon. Amazon is quite a large company but itâ€™s offering is nowhere near the size, scope or scale of what BSN is building. Because of this fact we clearly see BSN easily capturing this winner take all space. With BSN becoming the global blockchain infrastructure ecosystem April is well positioned as a leading oracle provider to the millions of smart contracts that will exist on this network.
