# 3. Token Economics

APRIL token aims to be multi-chained living on not just one but a multitude of chains at the core of the internet of blockchains. By being on more than one chain we will make use of AMM’s and cross chain protocols to provide APRIL token strong interchain tokenomics. APRIL token will be minted on the Binance Smart Chain under the BEP20 standard. A portion of the token base will be moved to Ethereum’s Uniswap V3 once it reaches mainnet via cross chain bridge. By taking advantage of the strong liquidity in the Binance Smart Chain & Ethereum ecosystem we aim to further strengthen the tokenomics both short and long term.

## **APRIL Token Buy & Burn Mechanism:** <a id="april-token-buy-and-burn-mechanism"></a>

All fees generated from April Oracle services minus network expenses will be used to buy APRIL tokens from the market. Any APRIL tokens bought from the market will be **burned** to reduce the circulating supply base and contribute to the appreciation of token value. APRIL token is not a security nor does it provide dividends, profit sharing or any other monetary entitlements.

Those who hold NEWB/NXTTY tokens will be distributed 20% of the APRIL token base. This distribution is because April project was created out of the Newb/Nxtty projects. April's genesis began with blockchain oracle design work done for Nxtty Altcoin Composite Index \(NxttyACCI\). This work was started more than 5 years ago and laid the foundation of what April is today. Distribution to NEWB/NXTTY token holders will begin after year 1 as outlined in the long-term token lock and release schedule.

## **Marketing & Development Fund:** <a id="marketing-and-development-fund"></a>

We hold marketing & development efforts in high regard so that is why we have set aside large portions of the token base for these efforts over the next coming years. 20% will be allocated for our marketing efforts which will be a priority for making April a leading project in this space. 20% will go towards development work of the project which will be lean, impactful and innovative so that we can maintain our competitive edge.
